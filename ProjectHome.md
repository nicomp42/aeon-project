Did you ever try to evaluate ontologies? Ever tried to apply OntoClean? Did you find it difficult and timeconsuming to tag all the concepts? We have a solution for you.

AEON (Automatic Evaluation of ONtologies) automatically tags concepts with appropriate OntoClean meta-properties. The implementation can be easily expanded to check the concepts for other abstract meta-properties, thus providing for the first time tool support in order to enable intensional ontology evaluation for concepts. Our main idea is using the web as an embodiment of objective world knowledge, where we search for patterns indicating concepts meta-properties. We get an automatic tagging of the ontology, thus reducing costs tremendously. Moreover, AEON lowers the risk of having subjective taggings.

OntoClean is a unique approach towards the formal evaluation of ontologies, as it analyses the intensional content of concepts. Although it is well documented in numerous publications, and its importance is widely acknowledged, it is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs for applying OntoClean, especially on tagging concepts with the correct meta-properties.

We believe that evaluation of Ontologies is important. Therefore we are working on lowering the burden associated with it. AEON is a highly valuable first step.
